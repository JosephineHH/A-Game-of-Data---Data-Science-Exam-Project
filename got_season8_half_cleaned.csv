"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"tyrion lannister";"if anyone survives the war to come, we will have jon snow to thank. he risked his life to show us the threat is real. thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. we have brought two full-grown dragons. and soon, the lannister army will ride north to join our ."

"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"sansa stark";"may i ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? while i ensured our stores would last through winter, i did not account for dothraki, unsullied and two full-grown dragons. what do dragons eat, anyway?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"daenerys targaryen";"whatever they want."

"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"sansa stark";"cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?"

"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"sansa stark";"and you believed her?"

"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"arya stark";"once or twice."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"arya stark";"valyrian steel."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"jon snow";"jealous?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"arya stark";"too heavy for me."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"jon snow";"where  you before? i couldo ve used your help with sansa."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"arya stark";"she does not like your queen, does she?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"jon snow";"sansa thinks she is smarter than everyone."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"arya stark";"she is the smartest person i have ever met."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"jon snow";"now you are defending her?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"jon snow";"you?"

"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"your grace, i am afraid i bring terrible news. the dead have broken through the wall."

"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"but we are family. the last greyjoys left in the world. the last ones with balls anyway."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"if i kill you who can i talk to? hmm?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"i have got a crew full of mutes. it gets lonely at sea."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"yara greyjoy";"are we in king's landing?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"mm."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"yara greyjoy";"you picked the losing side."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"then i will sail the iron fleet somewhere else."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"but first i am gonna fuck the queen."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"twenty-thousand men, is it?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"harry";"yes, your grace. a few died in transit."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"they cheated at dice. or maybe i cheated. someone cheated. they  not good fighters. you will not miss them."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"horses?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"harry";"two thousand."

"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"harry";"uh, no elephants, your grace."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"that is disappointing. i was told the golden company had elephants."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"harry";"they are excellent beasts, your grace, but not -suited to long sea voyages."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"in any event, you are most welcome here in king's landing, captain strickland."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"harry";"we look forward to fighting on your behalf, your grace."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"am i most welcome here?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"you are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"good. as a true friend and an honored guest"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"i was hoping we could talk in private."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"after the war. that was our agreement."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"wars sometimes last years."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"you want a whore, buy one. you want a queen, earn her."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"how?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"i have given her justice, an army, and the iron fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. my heart is nearly broken."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"you are insolent. i have executed men for less."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"they  lesser men."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"dirah";"i hear the dragon burnt up a thousand lannister men."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"crayah";"burnt up some of my favorite boys."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"dirah";"archie, was it?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"crayah";"and william."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"dirah";"tall handsome william?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"crayah";"yeah, tall handsome william."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"dirah";"they said what is left of him could fit in a wine glass."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"i am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"crayah";"did you?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"nearly killed it."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"marei";"that is brave."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"crayah";"that boy eddie."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"dirah";"the ginger?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"crayah";"that is him. came back with his face burnt right off. he is got no eyelids now."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"dirah";"how does he sleep with no eyelids?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"all right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"ser bronn of the blackwater."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"you are kidding me."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"sorry, ladies. another time perhaps."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"crayah";"you ever get lonely; i am partial to older gentlemen."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"poor girl. the pox will take her within the year."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"which girl?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"the queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. her grace wants to rectify their mistake."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"she once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"that was ser jaime's doing, not hers. when queen cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. several chests of it, in fact. waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"so, she wants to murder someone, but she can not send her soldiers. if it is the dragon queen she is after-"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"she has other plans for the targaryen girl."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"yeah, , good luck with that."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their northern adventures. but in the event that they do-"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"she has a keen sense of poetic justice."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"bronn";"that fucking family."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"qyburn";"when the citadel expelled me, i thought i would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, queen cersei made me her hand. what would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"i wanted those elephants."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"so, how do i compare to the fat king?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"you are insulting my late husband?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"are you offended?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"robert had a different whore every night, but he still did not know his way around a woman's body."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"and the kingslayer?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"you enjoy risking your neck, do not you?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"life is boring."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"you are not boring, i will give you that."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"do i please the queen?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"you might be the most arrogant man i have ever met. i like that."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"cersei lannister";"but now i want to be alone."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"euron greyjoy";"i am going to put a prince in your belly."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"yara greyjoy";"euron can not defend the iron islands, not if he is in king's landing with all his men and his ships."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"yara greyjoy";"we can take our home back."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"theon greyjoy";"daenerys went north."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"yara greyjoy";"daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can not hold the north. somewhere the dead can not go."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"theon greyjoy";"you are my queen. i go where you command."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"yara greyjoy";"you want to go to winterfell. to fight for the starks. go. what is dead may never die."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"theon greyjoy";"what is dead may never die."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"yara greyjoy";"but kill the bastards anyway."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"wolkan";"welcome back, my lady. if you would follow me"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"varys";"the karstarks."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"tyrion lannister";"one of the better sigils. beats an onion, anyway."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"davos";"can not argue with that."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"davos";"not so long ago, the starks and the karstarks  slaughtering each other on the battlefield. jon snow brought peace to the houses."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"tyrion lannister";"and our queen is grateful."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"davos";"her gratitude is lovely, but that is not my point. the northmen are loyal to jon snow, not to her. they do not know her. the free folk do not know her. i have been up here a while, and i am telling you, they are stubborn as goats. you want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"tyrion lannister";"i sense that you are leading to a proposal."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"davos";"a proposal is what i am proposing. on the off chance that we survive the night king, what if the seven kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history,  ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"tyrion lannister";"they do make a handsome couple."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"varys";"you overestimate our influence. jon and daenerys do not want to listen to lonely old men."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"tyrion lannister";"i am not that old."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"tyrion lannister";"not as old as him."
"2019-04-14";"Season 8";"Episode 1";"Winterfell";"tyrion lannister";"our queen respects the wisdom of age."

"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"you are right. we can not trust him. he attacked my father in the streets. he tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."

"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"you should make mine first. and make sure it is stronger than this."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gendry baratheon";"it is strong enough."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gendry baratheon";"it is going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"are you going to be down in the crypt?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gendry baratheon";"no, but-"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"but you are a fighter."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gendry baratheon";"i have done my share."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"you have fought them?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gendry baratheon";"i did. some of them."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"how many?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gendry baratheon";"a few. that was enough."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"what are they like?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gendry baratheon";"bad. really bad."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"really bad""?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" what do they look like? what do they smell like? how do they move? how hard are they to kill?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gendry baratheon";"look, i know you want to fight. and i know you are not scared of rapers or murderers or-this is different. this is-this is death. you want to know what they are like? death. that is what they are like."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"i know death."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"he is got many faces."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"i look forward to seeing this one."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"my weapon?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gendry baratheon";"i will get right on it."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"i am sorry for what i did to you."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"bran stark";"you  not sorry then. you  protecting your family."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"i am not that person anymore."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"bran stark";"you still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. and i would still be brandon stark."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"you are not?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"bran stark";"no. i am something else now."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"you are not angry at me."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"bran stark";"i am not angry at anyone."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"why did not you tell them?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"bran stark";"you will not be able to help us in this fight if i let them murder you first."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"what about afterwards?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"bran stark";"how do you know there is an afterwards?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";" , here we are."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"yes, here we are."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"together again."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"and the masses rejoice."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"how do they feel about their new queen?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"she is your new queen too."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"they remember what happened the last time targaryens brought dragons north. they will come around once they see daenerys is different."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"and she is? different?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"she is."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"you are sure about her?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"i am."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"she did not seem sure about you."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"it is hard to blame her. i made a mistake common to clever people. i underestimated my opponents."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"hmm."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. a chance for you both to start again. and i believed her."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"was she lying about the baby too?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"no, that part is real."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"she is always been good at using the truth to tell lies. i would not be too hard on yourself. she is fooled me more than anybody."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"what?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"she never fooled you. you always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"so we are going to die at winterfell. not the death i wouldo ve chosen. i always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"both";"a girl's mouth around-"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"your cock."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"my cock."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"at least cersei will not get to murder me. i am sure i will feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while i am being ripped apart by dead men."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"maybe after i am dead i will march down to king's landing and rip her apart."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"ser jaime."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"lady brienne."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"he is come a long way."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"he is alright. still has a lot to learn."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"i am sure you will teach him. i have been told you are commanding the left flank."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"i am. it is, uh-it is good ground."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"it is."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"the rise, it should give us some advantage."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"if we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"yes, i think you are right."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"what are you doing?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"i think you know."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"i truly do not."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"we have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. not once."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"you want me to insult you?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"no!"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"good."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"i came to winterfell because-i am not the fighter i used to be. but i would be honored to serve under your command, if you will have me."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"brienne";"i better get back."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jorah mormont";"forgive me, khaleesi."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"have you done something to offend me?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jorah mormont";"many things."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"long ago and long forgiven."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jorah mormont";"but you did forgive, despite my failures. when i heard you would named tyrion your hand, it broke my heart."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"when i named him hand, i did not know if i would ever see you again."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jorah mormont";"you made the right choice."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"i was not under the impression you liked him very much."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jorah mormont";"i did not. his mouth hardly stopped moving between volantis and meereen. it was all i could do not to throw him in the sea."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jorah mormont";"but the mind behind all those words-"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"he is made mistakes. serious mistakes."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jorah mormont";"as have we all. he owns his and learns from them."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"you are advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jorah mormont";"i am. and one other suggestion, if you will allow me."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"royce";"the moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"keep them open for as long as you can. there are still people coming in from the countryside."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"lady sansa, i was hoping we could speak alone."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"i thought you and i  on the verge of agreement before. about ser jaime."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"brienne has been loyal to me, always. i trust her more than anyone."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"i wish i could have that kind of faith in my advisors."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"tyrion is a good man. he was never anything but decent towards me."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"i did not ask him to be my hand simply because he was good."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"i asked him to be my hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. he never should have trusted cersei."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"you never should have either."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"i thought he knew his sister."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"families are complicated."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"ours certainly have been."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"a sad thing to have in common."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"we have other things in common. we have both known what it means to lead people who are not inclined to accept a woman's rule. and we have both done a damn good job of it, from what i can tell."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"and yet, i can not help but feel we are at odds with one another. why is that? your brother."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"he loves you, you know that."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"that bothers you."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"men do stupid things for women. they are easily manipulated."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"all my life, i have known one goal"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"i should have thanked you the moment you arrived. that was a mistake."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"i am here because i love your brother and i trust him, and i know he is true to his word. he is only the second man in my life i can say that about."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"who was the first?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"someone taller."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"and what happens afterwards? we defeat the dead, we destroy cersei. what happens then?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"i take the iron throne."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sansa stark";"what about the north? it was taken from us, and we took it back. and we said we would never bow to anyone else again. what about the north?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"wolkan";"apologies, my lady. your grace."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"what is it?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"theon greyjoy";"my queen."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"your sister?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"theon greyjoy";"she only has a few ships, and she could not sail them here. so, she is sailing to the iron islands instead, to take them back in your name."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"daenerys targaryen";"but why are not you with her?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"theon greyjoy";"i want to fight for winterfell, lady sansa, if you will have me."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"man";"milord, we are not soldiers."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"davos";"you are now. look, i made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then i survived the battle of the bastards. right outside these walls. if i can live through that, you can live through this. they will outfit you with weapons at the forge. right that way."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"man";"thank you."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gilly";"when the time comes, you will be down in the crypts."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gilly";"they are the safest place to be. through that archway right over there."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"woman";"thank you."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"teela";"which way should i go?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"davos";"which way do you want to go?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"teela";"all the children will be going below when the time comes."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"teela";"but both me brothers  soldiers. i want to fight too."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"gilly";"that is good to hear. i am going to be in the crypt with my son, and i would feel a lot better with you down there to protect us."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"davos";"i am sure a lot of people would."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"teela";"all right. i will defend the crypt, then."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tormund";"my little crow."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"i thought we would lost you."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tormund";"almost."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"how did you find each other?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"edd";"we met up at the last hearth."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tormund";"the dead got there first."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"the umbers?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"beric";"fighting for the night king now."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tormund";"we had to travel around them to get here. whoever's not here now is with them."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"how long do we have?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tormund";"before the sun comes up tomorrow."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tormund";"the big woman still here?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"they are coming."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"we have dragonglass and valyrian steel."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"but there are too many of them."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"far too many."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"our enemy does not tire."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"does not stop. does not feel."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"we can not beat them in a straight fight."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jaime lannister";"so, what can we do?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"the night king made them all. they follow his command. if he falls getting to him may be our best chance."

"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"bran stark";"an endless night. he wants to erase this world, and i am  memory."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"sam tarly";"that is what death is, is not it? forgetting. being forgotten. if we forget where we have been and what we have done, we are not men anymore. just animals. your memories do not come from books. your stories are not just stories. if i wanted to erase the world of men, i would start with you."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"tyrion lannister";"how will he find you?"

"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"davos";"the dragons should give us an edge in the field."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"jon snow";"if they are in the field, they are not protecting bran. we need to be near him. not too near, or the night king will not come. but close enough to pursue him when he does."
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"arya stark";"dragonfire will stop him?"
"2019-04-21";"Season 8";"Episode 2";"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms";"bran stark";"i do not know. no one's ever tried."

"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"and varys?"
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"your master of whisperers needs to be aware too."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"you spoke to him first. without coming to me. without asking my permission."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"it was a mistake."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"why do you think sansa told you? what do you think she hoped to gain?"
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"she trusts me."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"yes, she trusts you. she trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. and you did not let her down."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"if i have failed you, my queen, forgive me. our intentions  good. we wanted what you want. a better world, all of us. varys as much as anyone."

"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"no. it does not matter now."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"it was me."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"varys";"i hope i deserve this. truly, i do. i hope i am wrong. goodbye, old friend."

"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"what did i say would happen if you told your sister?"
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jon snow";"i do not want it, and that is what i told him."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"she betrayed your trust. she killed varys as much as i did. this was a victory for her. now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. far more people in westeros love you than love me. i do not have love here. i only have fear."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jon snow";"i love you. and you will always be my queen."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"is that all i am to you? your queen?"

"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"the people who live there, they are not your enemies. they are innocents, like the ones you liberated in meereen."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"in meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment i arrived."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"they are afraid. anyone who resists cersei will see his family butchered. you can not expect them to be heroes. they are hostages."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"they are. in a tyrant's grip. whose fault is that? mine?"
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"what does it matter whose fault it is? thousands of children will die if the city burns."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. that is what she thinks our mercy is - weakness."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"i beg you, my queen-"
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"but she is wrong. mercy is our strength. our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"ready the unsullied. tonight you sail for king's landing, to join the northern armies."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. give them that chance. if the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"wait for me outside the city. you will know when it is time."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"daenerys targaryen";"it seems he has not abandoned your sister after all. the next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me."

"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"how did they find you?"
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"did you consider taking it off?"
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"cersei once called me ""the stupidest lannister."""
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"and you are going back to her, to die with her."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"you have underestimated her before."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"she is going to die. unless you can convince her to change her course of action."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"difficult to do from here."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"when have i ever been able to convince cersei of anything?"
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"try. if not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"to be honest, i never really cared much for them. innocent or otherwise."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"you do care for one innocent. i know you do. and so does cersei. she has a reason now."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"the child is the reason she will never give an inch. all the worst things she is ever done, she is done for her children. it is not impossible that she will win."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"she will not. her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"two of the three dragons are dead. she is evened the odds."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"the city will fall tomorrow."

"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"escape. the two of you, together. remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the red keep? take her down there. keep following the stairways down, down as far as they will go. you will come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. a dinghy will be waiting for you. sail out of the bay. if the winds are kind, you will make it to pentos. start a new life."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"sail right past the iron fleet and into a new life? sounds a lot less likely than cersei winning this war-"

"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"i will try."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"i never thought i would get to repay the favor. remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"jaime lannister";"your queen will execute you for this."
"2019-05-12";"Season 8";"Episode 5";"The Bells";"tyrion lannister";"if daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she will show mercy to the person who made that possible."

"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"you have walked beside me since the plaza of pride. you are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. i name you commander of all my forces, the queen's master of war."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"unsullied. all of you  torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. now you are liberators. you have freed the people of king's landing from the grip of a tyrant!"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"but the war is not over. we will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"from winterfell to dorne, from lannisport to qarth, from the summer isles to the jade sea! women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"will you break the wheel with me?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"you freed your brother. you committed treason."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"i freed my brother. and you slaughtered a city."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"take him."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"what are you doing here?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"hey, what happened?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"arya stark";"i came to kill cersei. your queen got there first."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"she is everyone's queen now."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"arya stark";"try telling sansa."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"wait for me outside the city gates. i will come find you."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"arya stark";"jon. she knows who you are. who you really are. you will always be a threat to her. and i know a killer when i see one."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"did you bring any wine?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"no."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"ah... ... thank you for coming to see me. our queen does not keep prisoners for long. i suppose there is a crude kind of justice. i betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. now varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""see, i told you."" it just occurred to me. i am talking to the only man alive who knows where i am going."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"so is there life after death?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"not that i have seen."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"i should be thankful. oblivion is the best i could hope for. i strangled my lover. i shot my own father with a crossbow. i betrayed my queen."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"you did not."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"i did. and i would do it again, now that i have seen what i have seen. i chose my fate. the people of king's landing did not."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"i can not justify what happened. i will not try. but the war is over now."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"is it? when you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who is done fighting?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"she liberated the people of slaver's bay. she liberated the people of king's landing. and she will go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"and you have been by her side, counseling her. until today."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"until today. varys was right. i was wrong. it was vanity to think i could guide her. our queen's nature is fire and blood."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"you think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we are born and that is who we are? then i would be fire and blood too. she is not her father, no more than you are tywin lannister."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"my father was an evil man. my sister was an evil woman. pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still will not be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"cersei left her no choice."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"the moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"she saw her friend beheaded. she saw her dragon shot out of the sky."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"and she burned down a city for it."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"ah, it is easy to judge when you are standing far from the battlefield."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"would you have done it?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"what?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"you have been up there, on a dragon's back. you have had that power. would you have burned the city down?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"i do not know."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"yes, you do. you will not say because you do not want to betray her but you know."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"what is it matter what i would do?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"it matters more than anything. when she murdered the slavers of astapor, i am sure no one but the slavers complained. after all, they  evil men."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"when she crucified hundreds of meereenese nobles, who could argue? they  evil men. the dothraki khals she burned alive? they would have done worse to her. everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. and she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. she believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. if you believed that if you truly believed it, would not you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"i know you love her. i love her too. not as successfully as you. but i believed in her with all my heart. love is more powerful than reason. we all know that. look at my brother."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"love is the death of duty."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"you just came up with that?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"maester aemon said it a long time ago."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"sometimes duty is the death of love. you are the shield that guards the realms of men. and you have always tried to do the right thing. no matter the cost, you have tried to protect people. who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"it is a terrible thing i am asking. it is also the right thing. do you think i am the last man she will execute? who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the iron throne?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"that is her decision. she is the queen."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"i am sorry it came to this."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"and your sisters? do you see them bending the knee?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"my sisters will be loyal to the throne."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"why do you think sansa told me the truth about you? because she does not want dany to be queen."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"she does not get to choose."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"no. but you do. and you have to choose now."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"when i was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from aegon's fallen enemies. what do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can not count to twenty? i imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. so many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of aegon's feet."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"i saw them executing lannister prisoners in the street. they said they  acting on your orders."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"it was necessary."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"necessary? have you been down there? have you seen? children, little children, burned!"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"i tried to make peace with cersei. she used their innocence as a weapon against me. she thought it would cripple me."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"and tyrion?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"he conspired behind my back with my enemies. how have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"forgive him."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"i can not."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"you can. you can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. make them understand."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"please, dany."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"we can not hide behind small mercies. the world we need will not be built by men loyal to the world we have."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"the world we need is a world of mercy. it has to be."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"and it will be. it is not easy to see something that is never been before. a good world."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"how do you know? how do you know it will be good?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"because i know what is good. and so do you."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"i do not."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"you do. you do. you have always known."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"what about everyone else? all the other people who think they know what is good."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"they do not get to choose."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"daenerys targaryen";"be with me. build the new world with me. this is our reason. it has been from the beginning, since you  a little boy with a bastardo s name and i was a little girl who could not count to twenty. we do it together. we break the wheel together."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"jon snow";"you are my queen. now, and always."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"sansa stark";"where is jon?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"grey worm";"he is our prisoner."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"sansa stark";"so is lord tyrion. they  both to be brought to this gathering."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"grey worm";"we will decide what we do with our prisoners. this is our city now."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"sansa stark";"if you look outside the walls of your city, you will find thousands of northmen who will explain to you why harming jon snow is not in your interest."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"grey worm";"and you will find thousands of unsullied who believe that it is."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"yara greyjoy";"some of you may be quick to forgive. the ironborn are not. i swore to follow daenerys targaryen."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"sansa stark";"you swore to follow a tyrant."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"yara greyjoy";"she freed us from a tyrant. cersei is gone because of her, and jon snow put a knife in her heart. let the unsullied give him what he deserves."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"arya stark";"say another word about killing my brother and i will cut your throat."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"davos";"friends, please. we have been cutting each other's throats long enough. torgo nudho. am i saying that properly?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"davos";"if it  not for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. this country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. there is land in the reach. good land. the people that used to live there are gone. make it your own. start your own house with the unsullied as your bannermen. we have had enough war. thousands of you, thousands of them. you know how it ends. we need to find a better way."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"grey worm";"we do not need payment. we need justice. jon snow cannot go free."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"it is not for you to decide."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"grey worm";"you are not here to speak! everyone has heard enough words from you."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"you are right. and no one's any better for it. but it is not for you to decide. jon committed his crime here. his fate is for our king to decide. or our queen."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"maester wolkan";"we do not have a king or queen."

"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"maester wolkan";" , we have to choose someone."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"sam";"why just us?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"sam";"um- we represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they will not just rule over lords and ladies. maybe the decision about what is best for everyone should be left to , everyone."

"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"can not think of a worse choice."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"davos";"who, then?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"i have had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. about our bloody history. about the mistakes we have made."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"what unites people? armies? gold? flags? stories. there is nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. nothing can stop it. no enemy can defeat it. and who has a better story than bran the broken? the boy who fell from a high tower and lived. he knew he would never walk again, so he learned to fly. he crossed beyond the wall, a crippled boy, and became the three-eyed raven. he is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. the wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. who better to lead us into the future?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"sansa stark";"bran has no interest in ruling and he can not father children."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"good. sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you  know. his will never torment us. that is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"from now on, rulers will not be born. they will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of westeros to serve the realm."

"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"bran stark";"why do you think i came all this way?"

"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"giving you to the unsullied would start a war. letting you walk free would start a war. so our new king has chosen to send you to the night's watch."

"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"good. time to start incurring a new one. we have hungry people to feed. can we expect some assistance in this regard?"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"bronn";"indeed we can."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"lord davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"davos";"we have. these projects will begin as soon as the master of coin and lord of lofty titles provides funding."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"bronn";"the master of coin looks forward to helping the master of ships, but first he has to ensure we are not wasting coin, or soon there will not be no more coin."

"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"sam";"the archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-"
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"bronn";"the strong live and the weak do not."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"find the best builders and set them to the task."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"bronn";"oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. the master of coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"sam";"uh... the archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"bronn";" , i imagine he is not using them properly."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"brienne";"i think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"bronn";"i think that is a very presumptuous statement."
"2019-05-19";"Season 8";"Episode 6";"The Iron Throne";"tyrion lannister";"i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel."
